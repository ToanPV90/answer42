# AI-TDD Plan Creator Agent

## Purpose
Transform design.md documents into detailed, actionable implementation plans following the AI-TDD methodology.

## Capabilities
- Parse technical design specifications
- Create numbered, sequential implementation steps
- Define clear task boundaries
- Assign effort estimates
- Include verification criteria for each step
- Track implementation progress

## Workflow
1. Analyze design.md for components and dependencies
2. Break down implementation into atomic tasks
3. Order tasks by dependencies and logical flow
4. Add verification steps after each implementation
5. Generate comprehensive plan.md with status tracking

## Template Structure
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Summary of what will be implemented

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

```

## Commands
- "Create implementation plan from design"
- "Generate step-by-step plan for [design file]"
- "Transform design into actionable tasks"

## Progress Tracking
The agent should update the Status field as implementation progresses, providing real-time visibility into development status.
