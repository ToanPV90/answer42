# AI-TDD Documentation Workspace

This directory contains all the documentation generated by the AI-TDD agents, organized by feature development projects.

## Directory Structure

Each feature development project gets its own folder with all agent-generated documents:

```
ai-tdd-docs/
├── README.md                          # This file
├── [feature-name-1]/                  # Feature project folder
│   ├── idea.md                        # Agent 1: Idea Generator output
│   ├── PRD.md                         # Agent 2: PRD Creator output  
│   ├── design.md                      # Agent 3: Design Document output
│   ├── plan.md                        # Agent 4: Plan Creator output
│   └── test-reports/                  # Agent 6: Test Generator outputs
│       ├── coverage-report.html
│       ├── test-summary.md
│       └── generated-tests/
├── [feature-name-2]/                  # Another feature project
│   ├── idea.md
│   ├── PRD.md
│   ├── design.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── test-reports/
└── ...
```

## Feature Naming Convention

Feature folders should follow this naming pattern:
- **kebab-case**: `real-time-collaboration`
- **descriptive**: `user-authentication-system`
- **concise**: `paper-search-enhancement`

Examples:
- `real-time-collaboration/`
- `advanced-search-filters/`
- `user-dashboard-redesign/`
- `mobile-responsive-ui/`

## Document Lifecycle

Each feature follows the AI-TDD pipeline:

1. **idea.md** - Feature concept and feasibility (Agent 1)
2. **PRD.md** - Product requirements and user stories (Agent 2)  
3. **design.md** - Technical architecture and API design (Agent 3)
4. **plan.md** - Implementation steps and verification (Agent 4)
5. **Source Code** - Generated in `/src/` following plan.md (Agent 5)
6. **Test Reports** - Coverage and test files (Agent 6)

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting a New Feature
1. Create feature folder: `mkdir ai-tdd-docs/[feature-name]`
2. Begin with Agent 1 (Idea Generator)
3. Progress through each agent sequentially
4. Maintain documentation quality at each stage

### Agent Output Paths
Configure agents to output to the feature-specific folder:
- Idea Generator: `./ai-tdd-docs/[feature-name]/idea.md`
- PRD Creator: `./ai-tdd-docs/[feature-name]/PRD.md`
- Design Document: `./ai-tdd-docs/[feature-name]/design.md`
- Plan Creator: `./ai-tdd-docs/[feature-name]/plan.md`
- Test Generator: `./ai-tdd-docs/[feature-name]/test-reports/`

### Quality Standards
- Each document must be complete before proceeding
- Follow the templates defined in agent configurations
- Maintain traceability between documents
- Update previous documents if requirements change

## Active Features

Track current feature development status:

| Feature Name | Status | Current Stage | Last Updated |
|--------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| [Add features as they're created] | | | |

## Archive

Completed features remain in the ai-tdd-docs folder as reference documentation and implementation history.
