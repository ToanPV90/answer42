# Product Requirements Document: Semantic Search Integration

## Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the comprehensive integration of semantic search capabilities into Answer42, transforming how researchers discover and interact with academic papers. By leveraging PostgreSQL's pgvector extension and advanced vector embeddings, this feature will enable intelligent, context-aware paper discovery that goes beyond traditional keyword matching.

The semantic search integration addresses critical limitations in current research workflows, where researchers miss relevant papers due to terminology differences and limited search context understanding. This feature positions Answer42 as a leading academic research platform with AI-powered discovery capabilities.
