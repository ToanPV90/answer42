# 6. Future Considerations

This page outlines optional enhancements and long-term improvements beyond the initial implementation.

## 6.1 Chunked & Resumable Uploads

- **Chunked Upload Protocol**  
  Break large files into fixed-size parts (e.g., 5 MB chunks) and upload sequentially or in parallel.
- **Resumable Sessions**  
  Track upload progress server-side using session IDs; resume from last confirmed chunk on failure.
- **Standards**  
  Consider implementing RFC-9083 or tus.io protocol for broad client compatibility.

## 6.2 Content-Addressable Storage & Deduplication

- **Hash-Based Storage**  
  Compute cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of file; store unique content once, reference by hash.
- **Deduplication**  
  Prevent duplicate uploads by checking existing hash; speeding repeated uploads and reducing storage.

## 6.3 External Storage & CDN Integration

- **Object Storage**  
  Offload file storage to S3-compatible buckets (e.g., AWS S3, MinIO, Supabase Storage).
- **Streaming Download URLs**  
  Generate signed, time-limited URLs for client downloads.
- **CDN Caching**  
  Serve static assets via CDN (Cloudflare, Fastly) to reduce latency and offload origin server.

## 6.4 Client-Side Compression & Encryption

- **Compression**  
  Enable optional gzip or Brotli compression of chunks before upload to reduce bandwidth.
- **Client Encryption**  
  Encrypt data client-side (AES-GCM) for end-to-end confidentiality; decrypt on server before processing.

## 6.5 Alternative Transfer Protocols

- **gRPC Streaming**  
  Use gRPC bidirectional or client streaming for efficient binary transfers over HTTP/2.
- **WebSockets**  
  Provide fallback path for environments where HTTP multipart is problematic.

## 6.6 Enhanced Monitoring & ML-Driven Controls

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  Use ML to detect suspicious upload patterns (spikes in size or frequency) and trigger alerts.
- **Adaptive Limits**  
  Dynamically adjust size or rate limits per user based on historical behavior and service load.

## 6.7 UI/UX Enhancements

- **Progressive Previews**  
  Show first page or metadata preview while upload is in progress.
- **Drag-and-Drop Retry**  
  Automatically retry failed chunks or entire upload with minimal user interaction.
- **Mobile Customizations**  
  Optimize upload UI for mobile networks, gracefully degrade to background transfer.

## 6.8 Long-Term Scalability

- **Distributed Transfer**  
  Implement peer-to-peer or multi-source upload to aggregate bandwidth.
- **Edge Functions**  
  Offload initial chunk handling to edge compute near the user.
- **Microservice Split**  
  Separate upload service into its own microservice with dedicated scaling policy.
