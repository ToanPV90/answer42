# Large‐File Upload Performance Plan

## 1. Introduction

This multi‐page design document outlines improvements to our paper upload workflow for handling very large files. The goal is to identify bottlenecks, propose targeted enhancements, and lay out a step‐by‐step implementation and validation plan. Each page in this folder focuses on a specific aspect of the solution; files are kept under 300 lines of Markdown.

### 1.1 Objective

- Mitigate OutOfMemoryErrors and garbage‐collection spikes when users upload large PDFs (>50 MB).
- Optimize server‐side file I/O to reduce request‐thread blocking.
- Enforce configurable size limits and back‐pressure to protect service availability.
- Streamline integration with batch processing and credit validation services without heavy synchronous workloads.

### 1.2 Scope

- **Frontend (Vaadin UI)**: Replace in‐memory buffers with disk‐ or stream‐backed receivers.
- **Server Framework (Spring Boot)**: Configure multipart thresholds and request limits.
- **Persistence (File System)**: Use large‐buffered copy or asynchronous transfer to disk.
- **Threading & Concurrency**: Offload I/O to non‐servlet threads.
- **Monitoring & Limits**: Implement metrics, rate limiting, and size validation.
