Based on my research, here are your biggest competitors and what they offer:

## SciSpace - Your Primary Competitor

SciSpace is probably your closest competitor, offering AI-powered research assistance with over 270 million papers in their database. Here's what they provide:

Key Features:

- Chat with PDF functionality for interactive analysis
- AI assistant that explains dense paragraphs and technical terms
- Literature review generation and citation management
- Integration with Zotero for reference management

Pricing: Free plan with basic features, Premium at $12/month (billed annually), University plan at $8/user/month

Weaknesses: Limited free access to features, software performance issues with large documents, lacks research recommendation engine

## Elicit - Strong Systematic Review Focus

Elicit has over 2 million users and searches across 125 million papers. They're particularly strong in systematic reviews:

Key Features:

- Systematic reviews that take 80% less time than manual methods
- Automated data extraction, summarization, and citation management
- Three pricing tiers from free to $49/month for Pro plan

Pricing: Free Basic plan, Plus at $10-12/month, Pro at $42-49/month

## Scite - Citation Analysis Specialist

Scite focuses on "Smart Citations" that show whether articles support, contrast, or mention claims, with over 1.3 billion citations indexed. They're particularly strong at helping researchers understand how papers relate to each other.

## Your Competitive Advantages:

1. Multi-Agent Architecture: None of your competitors use your sophisticated 7-agent pipeline with specialized AI models for different tasks.

2. Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure: Your Spring Boot orchestration and resilience features are more robust than most competitors.

3. Three-Mode Chat System: Your specialized chat modes (Paper Chat, Cross-Reference, Research Explorer) using different AI models is unique.

4. Multi-Source Discovery: Your combination of Perplexity, Crossref, and Semantic Scholar gives broader coverage than competitors using single sources.

## Key Differentiators:

- Technical Sophistication: Your multi-agent pipeline is far more advanced than competitors' single-model approaches
- Quality Assurance: Your dedicated Quality Checker Agent for bias detection and accuracy verification
- Comprehensive Processing: End-to-end pipeline from PDF processing to citation formatting
- Smart Model Selection: Using the right AI model for each specific task rather than one-size-fits-all

Your biggest threat is probably SciSpace due to their established user base and similar feature set, but your technical architecture and enterprise approach could position you for the higher-value market segments they struggle to serve effectively.
