      * Error handling

### AI and Research Features

9. [Multi-Agent Pipeline](./09-multi-agent-pipeline.md)
   * Agent architecture
   * Paper processing pipeline
   * Agent communication protocol
   * Provider abstraction layer

10. [Chat System Architecture](./10-chat-system-architecture.md)
    * Chat service
    * Message storage
    * Paper-specific chat
    * Cross-reference chat
    * Research explorer chat

## Multi-Agent Paper Processing Pipeline

The Answer42 platform uses a sophisticated multi-agent system to process academic papers. This pipeline is detailed in [Multi-Agent Pipeline](./09-multi-agent-pipeline.md), but here's a high-level overview:

1. **Paper Upload & Processing**
   * PDF parsing and text extraction
   * Metadata extraction with AI
   * Structure identification (sections, figures, references)

2. **Content Analysis**
   * Summarization at multiple levels of detail
   * Key concept identification
   * Citation extraction and formatting
   * Relationship mapping between papers

3. **AI Chat Integration**
   * Context preparation for AI models
   * Citation tracking for verifiability
   * Specialized chat modes for different research tasks

4. **Cross-Reference Analysis**
   * Comparison between multiple papers
   * Identification of agreements/disagreements
   * Gap analysis in research
   * Citation network visualization

The multi-agent approach allows for:
* Specialized processing based on agent expertise
* Parallel processing of different aspects
* Quality checking and verification
* Adaptive resource allocation based on task complexity

Each agent in the system has a specific role and communicates through a standardized protocol. The orchestrator agent coordinates the workflow, ensuring that tasks are properly sequenced and that results are combined correctly.

## Database Schema for Analysis Storage

The system stores analysis results in dedicated tables, which are described in [Database Design](./04-database-design.md) and summarized here:

1. **Analysis Tasks**
   * Tracks requested paper analyses
   * Contains status tracking, paper_id, user_id, task type
   * Links to completed results via result_id

2. **Analysis Results**
   * Stores the actual content of completed analyses
   * Contains the analysis output text, metadata, and completion timestamps
   * Referenced when displaying analysis results or adding them to chats

3. **Chat Integration**
   * Analysis results can be seamlessly integrated into chat sessions
   * Stored as specialized message types with metadata linking to the analysis
   * Supports context tracking to maintain analysis references during conversations

## Getting Started with Development

For developers working on the Answer42 platform, these architecture documents provide comprehensive guidance on system design and implementation. The following steps are recommended for new developers:

1. Start with the [System Overview](./01-system-overview.md) to understand the high-level architecture
2. Review the [Frontend Architecture](./02-frontend-architecture.md) and [Backend Architecture](./03-backend-architecture.md) for your area of focus
3. Understand the [Database Design](./04-database-design.md) to work with data models
4. For AI features, study the [Multi-Agent Pipeline](./09-multi-agent-pipeline.md) and [Chat System Architecture](./10-chat-system-architecture.md)
5. For payment and subscription features, review the documents in section 8

All code should adhere to the coding standards documented in the project root.

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing new features or modifying existing ones, follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintainability**: Keep files under 300 lines of code
2. **Testability**: Write unit tests for all business logic
3. **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially for payment processing
4. **Performance**: Consider performance implications, especially for AI operations
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure UI components are accessible
6. **Mobile Support**: Design for mobile-first with desktop optimizations
7. **Internationalization**: Prepare for future localization

## Version Control

This architecture documentation is under version control alongside the codebase. Updates to the architecture should be reflected in these documents, and significant architectural changes should be discussed and approved before implementation.
